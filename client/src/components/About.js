        Since beginning my coding journey in late 2018, I have honed my skills as not only a good developer, but also an attractive personality for the job. I have worked remotely with partners on large projects, collaborated with multiple small groups towards a goal, and gained lots of experience in terms of finding answers to the problems at hand in just my few years of experience. I am focused, detail and improvement oriented, and always eager to learn and apply my skills whereever helpful!
